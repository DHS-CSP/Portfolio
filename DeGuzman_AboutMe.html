                <p>My name is Martin Angelo DeGuzman. I live in Dublin California and I am currently attending Dublin High School as a senior. At Dublin High, I am currently taking Computer Science Principles and have completed an Introduction to Engineering class and a Video Game Design class. A common factor I have noticed is my passion for technology and computers in general. The classes puts my skills to the test as there is many hands-on activities necessary to pass. My main focus is to become software engineer. Being a Sophomore in college now, I realize how much hard work and persistent in order for this dream to come true. That is why I am confident that my completed experience and academic achievements will be able to take me to places of success and happiness.</p>
                <p>From balancing my life, school, work, and social life, I have learned how to be independent, organized, and resourceful. I took a decent amount of advanced classes, did cross country and track and field during Freshman and Sophomore year of high school, as well as worked at multiple jobs my throughout my last years of high school and first years of college. Now that I am a Sophomore in college now, my current goal is getting an internship to get a better understanding of the industry was well as. Computer science has taught me that the possibilites are endless, and with machine learning, space exploration, and much more coming into the near future, it is all the more reason to get into computer science.</p>
                <p>Striving to become a software engineer means that I have hobbies similar to that category including building computers, repairing computers, and learning code for fun, and much more. Of course, I don't just do educational stuff, the Computer I built was for gaming, which is one of my favorite hobbies as well. Some of my favorite games at the moment include Overwatch, League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the games, it is not only very fun and entertaining, I have learned tactics and the importance of communication of a team to achieve a common goal; a good skill to have in the workforce. Fun fact, I wrote an essay on the benefits of playing video games back in Freshman Year. What I'm trying to say is that part of being a computer scientist to me is to have fun while doing something you love ultimately, and I believe these extracurricular activities will also help me achieve that goal. Nonetheless, thank you for spending the time to read my about me page. If you wish to learn more, you can see all the projects I have done in my high school career or you can find my email at the contact me section.</p>
